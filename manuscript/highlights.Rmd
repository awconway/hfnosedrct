- High flow nasal oxygen at 50L/min for patients undergoing elective CIED procedures with sedation is highly unlikely to *decrease* or *increase* peak TcCO~2~ concentration by a clinically important amount.

- There was no discernable trend observed in how the difference in peak TcCO~2~ varied with procedure time.

- Satisfaction with sedation is very likely to be similar between high flow nasal oxygen and facemask oxygen.

- The high flow nasal oxygen device was rated as more difficult for Anesthesia Assistants to use, although none rated the HFNO device as *difficult*.
