abstract = "In Bayesian hierarchical regression models, intrinsic Gaussian Markov random fields (IGMRFs) are commonly applied to model underlying spatial or temporal dependency structures. IGMRFs have a scaled precision matrix that reflects the neighbourhood structure of the model, while the scaling is represented as a random precision parameter. The hyperprior chosen for the precision parameter influences the degree of smoothness of the resulting field and this can have a strong effect on posterior results. We suggest that hyperpriors for the precision parameters should be selected according to the type of IGMRF used. Also, hyperpriors for different types of IGMRFs can be selected to give the same degree of smoothness, a priori. This is achieved by mapping the random precision to the marginal standard deviation of the IGMRF and recalculate hyperpriors used for different models. Also, the parameters of the hyperprior can be interpreted in terms of the marginal standard deviation. The given ideas are demonstrated by analysing two different types of spatial data in R-INLA, including a district-level analysis of survival data and the analysis of a spatial point pattern discretized to a grid."

abstract={Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.
